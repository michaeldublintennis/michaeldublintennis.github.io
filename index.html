                <p>
                The Greater Huntsville Section of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)
                will hold its first ever Young Professionals Symposium on October 20-21, 2016 at the Dynetics
                facility in Huntsville, Alabama (<a href="www.aiaayps-hsv.com">www.aiaayps-hsv.com</a>). The purpose of this meeting is to
                provide an opportunity for young professionals to give a technical presentation to a group of
                peers and promote opportunities for interaction (technical and non-technical) with senior
                professionals in attendance. Registration is $15 for all AIAA members, presenters, and Dynetics
                employees and $25 for others.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                In additional to technical presentations, the symposium will also include panel discussions
                alongside professional development and networking opportunities.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                To be considered a young professional, the presenter must be 35 years of age or under at the
                time of abstract submission. As travel to national and international conferences tends to be
                difficult for YPs, this is a unique opportunity for young professionals in academia, industry, and
                government to present their work and identify opportunities for alignment and collaboration in
                a more local setting.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The symposium will be 2 days in length with 7 planned technical sessions. The symposium
                organizing committee calls for abstracts related to presentations in the following areas:
