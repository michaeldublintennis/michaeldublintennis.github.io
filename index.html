                <h4>"I take your game where it's never been"</h4>
                <p>Tennis as a sport has advanced at an incredible pace over the years. Gone are the days of the awkward, unnatural techniques that dominated the sport of decades past. I teach my students the modern sport of tennis, which embraces the body's natural mechanics. In my more than 20 years experience coaching students of all ages and levels of play, I've kept up with the latest research, teaching methods, and play style used by the most successful players, coaches, and organizations around the world at all levels.</p>
                <p>If you're new to the game, I will help you quickly develop a solid foundation for this life-long sport. If you're a seasoned veteran who hasn't taken a lesson in a couple of years, I will modernize your game. If you play recreationally, you'll enjoy how natural the modern game feels. And if you play competitively, you'll enjoy the massive advantage these skills will give you.</p>
                <p>No matter your goals or level of experience, I gaurantee that I will take your game where it's never been.</p>
